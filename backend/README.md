# 🛠️ User Authentication API

This section documents the authentication endpoints (`/users/register` and `/users/login`) for your Node.js application. These endpoints handle user registration and login functionality with secure password handling and JWT-based authentication.

---

## 📦 POST `/users/register`

Registers a new user and returns a **JWT token** along with user data.

### ✅ Description

This endpoint creates a new user account. It requires the user's full name, email, and password. Passwords are hashed securely using **bcrypt**, and a **JWT** is returned on successful registration.

---

### 📥 Request Body

```json
{
  "fullname": {
    "firstname": "John",
    "lastname": "Doe"
  },
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "secret123"
}
```

    "_id": "user_id",
    "fullname": {
      "firstname": "John",
      "lastname": "Doe"

---

## 🔒 GET `/users/profile`

Fetch the authenticated user's profile information.

### ✅ Description

This endpoint returns the currently logged-in user's data. It requires a valid JWT token, which should be sent via `Cookie` or `Authorization` header.

---

### 📤 Response

#### ✅ 200 OK

```json
{
  "_id": "user_id",
  "fullname": {
    "firstname": "John",
    "lastname": "Doe"
  },
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

---

### ❌ 401 Unauthorized

{
  "message": "Unauthorized: No token provided"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "message": "Unauthorized: Invalid token"
}
```

---

### 🔐 Authorization

- ✅ Requires a valid JWT token via:
  - Cookie: `token=<JWT>`
  - OR Header: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`

---

## 🚪 POST `/users/logout`

Logs out the authenticated user by clearing the cookie and blacklisting the token.

### ✅ Description

This endpoint clears the authentication token from cookies and prevents future use by blacklisting it. Useful for safely logging users out.

---

### 📤 Response

#### ✅ 200 OK

```json
{
  "message": "Logged Out"
}
```

---

### ❌ 500 Internal Server Error

```json
{
  "message": "Internal Server Error"
}
```

---

### 🔐 Authorization

- ✅ Requires a valid JWT token via:
  - Cookie: `token=<JWT>`
  - OR Header: `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>`

---

## 🛡️ BlacklistToken Model

This model is used to **store and manage blacklisted JWT tokens** after a user logs out. It prevents the reuse of invalidated tokens and enhances the security of your authentication system.

---

### 🔍 Schema Fields

| Field       | Type   | Required | Description                                              |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `token`     | String | ✅ Yes   | The JWT token to be blacklisted. Must be unique.         |
| `createdAt` | Date   | ❌ No    | Automatically set to current time. Used for TTL expiry.  |

---

### ⏳ Expiry

- The `expires` option in the `createdAt` field ensures **MongoDB automatically deletes** the token document **24 hours after insertion**.
- This helps keep your database clean and removes stale blacklisted tokens automatically.

---

### 💡 Why Use This?

- Prevents reuse of old JWT tokens after logout.
- Helps enforce **stateless** session invalidation.
- Automatically expires old tokens using MongoDB TTL.

---

### 🧪 Notes

- Blacklisted tokens are stored to prevent reuse.
- If the user tries to access protected routes after logout, they will receive a `401 Unauthorized`.

## ⚠️ Token Blacklisting

- When a captain logs out, their JWT token is saved in a blacklist.
- Any further use of a blacklisted token will result in unauthorized access (`401`).

---

## 🧠 Notes

- Passwords are not returned thanks to `select: false` in the model.
- Tokens expire after `24h`.
- `authCaptain` middleware validates and attaches the authenticated captain to `req.captain`.
